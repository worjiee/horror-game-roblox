## The Last Shift - Design Doc (Prototype)

### Core Loop
- Restore power, check cameras, reset generators.
- The entity roams the facility and reacts to sound and light.
- Hide in lockers, under desks, or in dark rooms to avoid detection.
- Tension comes from uncertainty and atmosphere, not constant jump scares.

### Systems (Prototype Scripts)
- Tasks: server tracks a small ordered list; client presses E to complete current task.
- Monster: appears unpredictably; only moves when not being looked at.
- Flashlight: limited battery, drains while on.
- Minimal UI: task text + battery percentage.

### Audio and Atmosphere
- Distant metal impacts, low ventilation hum, and occasional whispers.
- Footsteps and breathing scale with monster proximity.
- Use light flicker and fog to obscure long corridors.

### Environment Storytelling
- Broken equipment near generator room.
- A handwritten note on a desk.
- Blood stains along the main corridor.

### Multiple Endings (Planned)
- Survive until shift ends.
- Escape early by restoring power and unlocking exits.
- Fail: player is found by the entity.

### Controls (Prototype)
- F: Toggle flashlight
- H: Toggle hide
- E: Complete current task (temporary input for testing)
